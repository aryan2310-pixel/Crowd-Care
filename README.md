# Crowd-Care
A web-based platform that enables citizens to easily report local issues (e.g., potholes, broken streetlights, sanitation problems) with geo-tagged photos and descriptions. The system automatically assigns issues to the correct government department, allows officials to update progress, and notifies citizens in real-time.
